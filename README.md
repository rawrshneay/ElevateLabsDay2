I analyzed a suspicious email claiming to be from Microsoft, which warned of a high-severity phishing alert. As part of the investigation, I examined the sender’s email address, headers, embedded links, and the content of the message. The sender’s domain (email-records.com) was found to be fake, and the message showed "sent by Unknown," indicating potential spoofing. The email used urgent language and contained a “View alert details” button, which likely leads to a malicious site. I also noticed inconsistencies in the timestamps and a lack of personalization—both common signs of phishing. While there were no major grammar mistakes, the message was vague and unprofessional. Based on these findings, I concluded that the email is a phishing attempt.
